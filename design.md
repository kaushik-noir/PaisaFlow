# PaisaFlow — UI/UX & Product Design Specification
---

## 1. Design Vision

PaisaFlow should feel like a **trusted business companion**, not an accounting application.

The target entrepreneur should not need to understand:
 Accounting terminology
 Financial dashboards
 Business analytics
 AI/ML
  Spreadsheets
  Long forms
  Complex financial software
  The user should be able to open PaisaFlow and simply say:
> **“Mujhe business expand karna hai.”**
PaisaFlow handles the complexity behind the scenes.

# 2. Design Principles
## 2.1 Voice First
The microphone is the primary interaction.
Primary CTA:
> 🎙️ **BOLIYE**
Typing is available as a fallback.
---
## 2.2 One Question at a Time
Never begin with a long financial form.
### Avoid

```text
Business name
Revenue
Expenses
Inventory
Customers
Loan
Interest
Tenure
Location
...
```
### Prefer
```text
PaisaFlow:
"Mahine ki approx sales kitni hoti hai?"
User:
"₹80,000"
PaisaFlow:
"Monthly kharcha approx kitna hai?"
```
---
## 2.3 Simple Language
Do not simply translate technical terminology.

Instead of:

> “Your DSCR is below the recommended threshold.”
Say:

> **“Loan ki monthly payment aapke current cash-flow par pressure daal sakti hai.”**

Advanced users can open:

> **Details dekhein**

---

## 2.4 Action Over Analytics

Every major analysis should end with:

# **AAJ KE TOP 3 ACTIONS**

Example:

```text
1. 💰 Cash buffer improve karein
2. 📞 Pending payments follow-up karein
3. 🔮 Lower loan scenario compare karein
```
---

## 2.5 Trust Before Intelligence

Important outputs should distinguish:

```text
FACT
OBSERVATION
ESTIMATE
ASSUMPTION
AI EXPLANATION
```

Never hide uncertainty.

---

## 2.6 User Control

PaisaFlow can prepare an action, but consequential external actions require approval.

```text
AI DRAFT
   ↓
USER REVIEW
   ↓
USER APPROVES
   ↓
ACTION
```
---

# 3. Visual Identity

PaisaFlow should feel:

- Trustworthy
- Calm
- Friendly
- Modern
- Indian
- Accessible
- Responsible
- Non-intimidating

Avoid making it look like:

- A stock-trading terminal
- A corporate ERP
- A traditional banking portal
- A generic ChatGPT clone

---

# 4. Color System

## Primary Green

```text
#33B878
```
Use for:

- Primary CTA
- Positive actions
- Growth indicators
- Voice interaction
- Selected states

## Deep Green

```text
#1F7350
```
Use for:

- Headings
- Important labels
- Trust indicators

## Background

```text
#F7FAF8
```

## Surface

```text
#FFFFFF
```

## Text

```text
Primary:   #1F2937
Secondary: #64748B
Muted:     #94A3B8
```
## Status

```text
Success: #33B878
Warning: #F5C85B
Risk:    #E96A6A
Info:    #5BAEEB
```

Status colors must communicate state, not decoration.

---

# 5. Typography

Recommended:

```text
Primary:
Inter / System Sans

Hindi:
Noto Sans Devanagari
```

### Hierarchy

```text
H1      30–36 px
H2      22–28 px
H3      17–20 px
Body    15–17 px
Small   12–14 px
```

For low-literacy users:

- Large text
- High contrast
- Short sentences
- Generous spacing
- Minimal dense paragraphs

---

# 6. Iconography

Use simple, familiar icons.

```text
🎙️ Voice
💰 Money
🏪 Business
📦 Inventory
👥 Customers
💳 Loan
📈 Growth
⚠️ Risk
📍 Local
🧠 Memory
🔮 Simulation
✓ Action
```

Production implementation should use a consistent SVG icon library rather than emoji wherever possible.

---

# 7. Layout System

## Mobile-first

Primary design target:

```text
360–430 px
```

Secondary:

```text
768–1024 px
```

Desktop:

```text
1200 px+
```

Use a responsive grid.

### Mobile

Single-column cards.

### Tablet

Two-column dashboard where appropriate.

### Desktop

Three-column information layout can be used for advanced views.

---

# 8. Navigation

## Mobile

Maximum 4–5 primary destinations.

```text

┌─────────────────────────────┐
│                             │
│          CONTENT            │

├─────────────────────────────┤
│ 🏠       🎙️       📊      🧠 │
│ Home     Talk    Business Memory
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

Recommended:

1. Home
2. Talk
3. Business
4. Insights
5. Memory/Profile

The **Talk** action should be visually dominant.
